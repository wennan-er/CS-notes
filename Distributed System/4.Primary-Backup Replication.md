# Primary-Backup Replication

* Failures  
  * can handle - fail-stop faults
    * fan stops working, CPU overheats and shuts itself down  
    * someone trips over replica's power cord or network cable  
    * software notices it is out of disk space and stops  
  * can not handle - bugs  
  
### Two main replication approaches
#### State Transfer - memory   
* Primary replica executes the service  
* Primary sends [new] state to backups  

#### Replicated State Machine  
* Clients send operations to primary, primary sequences and sends to backups.  
*  All replicas execute all operations  
    * same start state,  
    * same operations,  
    * same order, deterministic,    
    * then same end state.
