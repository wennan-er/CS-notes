# Primary-Backup Replication

* Failures  
  * can handle - fail-stop faults
    * fan stops working, CPU overheats and shuts itself down  
    * someone trips over replica's power cord or network cable  
    * software notices it is out of disk space and stops  
  * can not handle - bugs  
  
### Two main replication approaches
#### State Transfer - memory   
* Primary replica executes the service  
* Primary sends [new] state to backups  

#### Replicated State Machine  
* Clients send operations to primary, primary sequences and sends to backups.  
*  All replicas execute all operations  
    * same start state,  
    * same operations,  
    * same order, deterministic,    
    * then same end state.  

* State transfer is simpler  
  * But state may be large, slow to transfer over network  

* Replicated state machine often generates less network traffic  
  * Operations are often small compared to state  
  * But complex to get right  
  * VM-FT uses replicated state machine   

#### Things to consider
* What state to replicate?    
* P/B sync (primary execute ahead of backup?)    
* Cut-over (P falis before B, switch over)
* Anomalies  
* New Replicas
