## Consistency  
#### Why is distributed storage hard?  
* high performance -> shard data over many servers.  
* many servers -> constant faults.  
* fault tolerance -> replication.  
* replication -> potential inconsistencies.  
* better consistency -> low performance.  

### Consistency  
* Same behavior as a single server, server executes client operations one at a time (even if concurrent).  
* Reads reflect previous writes even if server crashes and restarts.  

#### Example of Strong Consistency Model  
* suppose C1 and C2 write concurrently, and after the writes have completed, C3 and C4 read. what can they see?  
```go
    C1: Wx1
    C2: Wx2
    C3:     Rx?
    C4:         Rx?
```
* Answer: either 1 or 2, but both have to see the same value.
